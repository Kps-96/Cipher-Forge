# Cipher Forge Cryptography Algorithm

## Overview 
Cipher Forge is a robust encryption and decryption algorithm that combines AES, RSA, HMAC, and QWERTY-based transformation to ensure data security and integrity. It enhances encryption by mapping characters using a QWERTY-based shift and encoding the output in an extended ASCII format for obfuscation.

## Features
- ✅RSA Encryption: Secures the AES key for safe transmission.

- ✅AES-GCM Encryption: Ensures confidentiality of transformed text.

- ✅HMAC Authentication: Verifies data integrity and prevents tampering.

- ✅QWERTY-Based Mapping: Adds an extra layer of obfuscation.

- ✅Extended ASCII Encoding: Makes encrypted data less recognizable.

## Dependencies

Install the required libraries before running the script:

```bash
pip install pycryptodome
```

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the script.

2. Run the script using Python:

```bash
python cipher_forge.py
```
3. Enter the text you want to encrypt when prompted.

4. The program will display:

- Encrypted Data (Extended ASCII)

- RSA Encrypted AES Key

5. The program will then decrypt the data, verify authenticity using HMAC, and output the original message.

## Algorithm Workflow
### Encryption Steps
1. QWERTY Mapping Transformation:
- Letters are shifted based on text length.
- Example: HELLO (length 5) → YWLLO
2. AES Encryption:
- Encrypted with a randomly generated AES key.
3. HMAC Generation:
- Ensures data integrity.
4. Extended ASCII Conversion:
- Makes the encrypted output unreadable.
5. RSA Encryption of AES Key:
- AES key is encrypted for secure transmission.

### Decryption Steps
1. Reverse Extended ASCII Encoding.
2. Extract and Decrypt AES Key using RSA.
3. AES Decryption of Encrypted Text.
4. Verify HMAC Integrity.
5. Reverse QWERTY Mapping to Restore the Original Text.

## Example Execution
### Input:
```bash 
Enter text to encrypt: HELLO
```

### Output:
```bash 
--- Encrypted Data ---
🔐 Encrypted Text (Extended ASCII): ˜šŸšœŸ€žŸŒ€œ€ž
🔑 RSA Encrypted AES Key: MII... (truncated)

--- Decryption Process ---
✅ HMAC verified! Message is authentic.
🔓 Decrypted Text: HELLO
```

## Security Benefits
- 🔹Hybrid Cryptography (AES + RSA): Provides both speed and security.

- 🔹Data Integrity with HMAC: Detects unauthorized modifications.

- 🔹QWERTY-based Mapping: Adds unpredictability to the encryption process.

- 🔹Extended ASCII Encoding: Makes brute-force attacks harder.

# Conclusion
Cipher Forge is a highly secure encryption system designed to protect sensitive data. By integrating AES, RSA, HMAC, and QWERTY transformations, it offers strong encryption, integrity checks, and added obfuscation.
